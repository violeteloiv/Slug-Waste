# SlugWaste

**SlugWaste** is a project to bring awareness to food waste in UC Santa Cruz's dining halls by self-reporting which meals go to waste the most. 

Our goal is to give insight into which meals can be improved upon for student satisfaction, along with providing tangible statistics on this matter.
